# zsh

My zsh config

## Setup

1. Clone this repo to `~/.config/zsh`
2. `cd` to `~/.config/zsh` and run `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
3. Run `./setup.sh`

IMPORTANT: `setup.sh` will overwrite the content of `~/.zshenv` so create a backup if you want to keep it.
The setup script will set `ZDOTDIR` to `~/.config/zsh` and setup antidote - a plugin manager for zsh.
